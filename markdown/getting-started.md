# Getting started with Stylix

## Installation

Stylix can be installed with **npm** or **yarn**:

```sh
$ npm install --save @stylix/core
# or
$ yard add @stylix/core
```

Stylix is compatible with React 16.8+.

## Wrap your app with a `<StylixProvider>` element

Start by importing `StylixProvider` from `@stylix/core` and placing a `<StylixProvider>` element at the root of your app:

```tsx
import { StylixProvider } from '@stylix/core';

function App() {
  return (
    <StylixProvider>
      { /* your app */ }
    </StylixProvider>
  )
}
```

The `<StylixProvider>` element can provide [themes](/themes), [media queries](/media-queries), and [plugins](/plugins) to descendent elements, and allows additional configuration for certain less-common situations.

## Use Stylix's stylable HTML elements

```tsx
import $ from '@stylix/core';
```

The default export from `@stylix/core` is both a React component (used to style non-Stylix components; described in [Styling other components](/other-components)), as well as a "namespace" object that contains stylable HTML elements. 

> Throughout this documentation, we always import this default object as `$`, but you can name it whatever you like.

Stylix provides all the standard HTML elements as properties of the `$` object (e.g. `<$.div>`, `<$.h1>`, `<$.p>`, etc.). Use these elements to create HTML markup that can be styled with propsâ€”they all accept props for any standard CSS property, in both `camelCase` and `kebab-case` formats. Of course, they also all accept the appropriate other standard HTML attributes (`onClick`, `href` for `<$.a>`, etc).

```tsx-render
import $ from '@stylix/core';

<$.div
  color="SkyBlue"
  text-align="center"
  font-size={40}
  font-weight="bold"
  font-style="italic"
>
  Hello, Stylix!
</$.div>
```

> **Note:** Numeric values (like `font-size={40}` above) are interpreted as pixel values for CSS properties that make sense.

You aren't just limited to standard CSS properties, either. Stylix lets you use [complex selectors, pseudo-classes, nested CSS](/selectors), [media queries](/media-queries), [keyframe animations](/keyframe-animations), [themes](/themes), and more.

Stylix generates a unique, deterministic class name for these styles and applies it to the element. The generated class name is a hash of the given styles, and any components sharing identical styles will receive the same class name. By default, Stylix places these CSS declarations a `<style>` element in the document's `<head>`, but this behavior can be customized by the `<StylixProvider>`. 

### Create reusable styled components just like regular components

Although your app's JSX markup will be longer and seem more verbose with these additional style props, Stylix's simple use of props to create styles allows you to leverage basic JavaScript syntax and React features to keep your code concise and organized.

By using **destructuring** and **spreading**, you can create reusable styled components that allow you to override styles easily:

```tsx-render
const Emphasize = (props) => (
  <$.div font-weight="bold" {...props} />
);

<>
  <Emphasize>
    Stylix!
  </Emphasize>
  <Emphasize font-size="22pt">
    Large Stylix!
  </Emphasize>
  <Emphasize font-weight="normal" font-style="italic">
    Italic Stylix!
  </Emphasize>
</>
```

This `Emphasize` component simply renders a `<div>` with bold text. Because we spread `...props` onto the `$.div` element, it also receives all the style props and children passed from the component that renders it.

### Allow style overrides with **prop spreading**

Spreading and destructuring allow you to customize how props are passed to the underlying element. For example, If you don't want to allow overriding particular styles, just place them *after* the prop spread. In the following example, the `font-weight` property can't be overridden, but other style props will be passed normally.

```tsx-render
const Emphasize = (props) => (
  <$.div {...props} font-weight="bold" />
);

<Emphasize color="crimson" font-weight="normal">
  Still bold
</Emphasize>
```

### Use non-style props with **destructuring**

If a component accepts other props that should not be passed on as CSS properties, you can use destructuring to separate them from style props:

```tsx-render
function DisplayName(props) {
  const { firstName, lastName, ...styles } = props;
  return (
    <$.div {...styles}>
      {lastName}, {firstName}
    </$.div>
  );
}

<DisplayName 
  firstName="Jim"
  lastName="Henson"
  font-weight="bold" 
  font-style="italic"
/>
```

Notice how these features don't come from Stylix, but instead are simply a result of the way it integrates with React.

## Styles are naturally dynamic

Of course, styles don't need to be fixed, constant values. Just like any other props, the values can come from a component's state, prop values, or any other variable. In the following example, a dropdown value is stored in a state variable, which is used to set the color of the text below it:

```tsx-render-app
function App() {
  const [color, setColor] = React.useState('tomato');

  return (
    <div>
      <select 
        onChange={e => setColor(e.target.value)}
      >
        <option>Tomato</option>
        <option>DodgerBlue</option>
        <option>SeaGreen</option>
      </select>
      <$.div color={color}>{color}</$.div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Because styles are created with props, they become "first-class citizens" of your React app, and you can treat them as dynamically as you would any other prop values. Stylix is very efficient in how it generates CSS and can process thousands of updates per second, and it cleans up after itself when styles are no longer in use.
