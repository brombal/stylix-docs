# Keyframe animations

Keyframe animations are easy to use in Stylix. Because CSS requires them to be defined at the global level, Stylix provides some convenience helpers to make this easier to manage.

To avoid "polluting" the global scope with potentially conflicting animation names, Stylix can generate the animation's name for you, using the `useKeyframes()` hook. This hook returns the name of the animation, which you can pass to the `animation` or `animation-name` style props.

```tsx-app
function App() {
  const myAnimation = useKeyframes({
    from: { transform: 'scale(1)' },
    to: { transform: 'scale(1.1)' },
  });

  return (
    <$.div animation={`1s ${myAnimation} infinite alternate`}>
      Animated!
    </$.div>
  )
}
```

The keyframe definition is made up of Stylix CSS objects, and they support all the features Stylix offers such as [media query arrays](/media-queries) and [theme functions](/themes).

The animation name is generated by hashing the style values, so keyframe animation definitions that share identical styles will not be duplicated.

If you don't care about adding keyframe animation names to your global scope, you can use the `useGlobalStyles()` hook to define the animation (see [global styles](/global-styles) for more details):

```tsx-render-app
import { useGlobalStyles } from '@stylix/core';

function App() {
  useGlobalStyles({
    "@keyframes myAnimation": {
      from: { transform: 'scale(1)' },
      to: { transform: 'scale(1.1)' },
    }
  });

  return (
    <$.div animation="1s myAnimation infinite alternate">
      Animated!
    </$.div>
  )
}
```
