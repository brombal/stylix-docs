# Keyframe animations

Keyframe animations are easy to use in Stylix. Because CSS requires them to be defined at the global level, Stylix provides some convenience helpers to make this easier to manage.

If you don't want to "pollute" the global scope with potentially-conflicting animation names, Stylix can generate the animation's name for you, using the `useKeyframes()` hook. This hook returns the name of the animation, which you can pass to the `animation` or `animation-name` style props.

```tsx-app
function App() {
  const myAnimation = useKeyframes({
    from: { transform: 'scale(1)' },
    to: { transform: 'scale(1.1)' },
  });

  return (
    <$.div animation={`1s ${myAnimation} infinite alternate`}>
      Animated!
    </$.div>
  )
}
```

The name is generated by hashing the style values, so keyframe animations that share identical definitions will not be duplicated.

If you don't care about polluting your global scope with keyframe animation names, you can use the `useStyles()` hook to define a global keyframe animation, just as you would define any other global styles:

```tsx-app
function App() {
  useStyles({
    "@keyframes myAnimation": {
      from: { transform: 'scale(1)' },
      to: { transform: 'scale(1.1)' },
    }
  }, true); // true for global styles

  return (
    <$.div animation="1s myAnimation infinite alternate">
      Animated!
    </$.div>
  )
}
```

The keyframe definition is just style objects, and they support all the other features Stylix offers such as **media query arrays** and **theme functions**.
