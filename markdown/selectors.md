# Pseudo-classes and selectors

Stylix elements aren't limited to just CSS propertiesâ€”you can also use pseudo-classes and complex selectors to apply styles. 

Because these strings (such as `:hover` or `div > span + a`) can't be used as JSX props (their syntax is incompatible), we need another way to specify them.

## The `$css` prop

The `$css` prop is accepted by all Stylix html elements (`<$.div>`, `<$.span>`, etc), and takes an object of additional styles to apply to an element. These styles can be not only simple CSS property/value pairs, but also pseudo-classes or complex selectors with nested style objects.

```tsx-render
import $ from '@stylix/core';

<$.ul
  font-weight="bold"
  $css={{
    li: {
      listStyleType: 'circle',
      marginLeft: 30,
    }
  }}
>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</$.ul>
```

Stylix scopes all selectors in the `$css` object under the element that defines them. In the above example, the styles for `li` are local to only the elements under the `ul`.

## Referencing the parent selector with `&`

To reference the element's own class name, you can use `&` (as is the convention in the many CSS-like languages that support nested styles). 

Note that this is necessary when using certain pseudo-classes, such as `:hover`:

```tsx-render
import $ from '@stylix/core';

<$.a
  color="YellowGreen"
  $css={{
    // Notice the use of quotes to support the more complex syntax.
    "&:hover": {
      color: "DarkOliveGreen"
    }
  }}
>
  Hover here
</$.a>
```

The use of `&` here applies the hover styles directly to this element, rather than its descendants. Without the `&`, the selector would only match hovered elements *within* the `<a>`, which is probably not what is intended. 

The `&` is useful in a variety of situations. Style objects can be nested infinitely deep, and selectors without the `&` symbol will be appended to the parent selector. You can use `&` anywhere that you want the selector to result in anything other than this default behavior.

## `$css` all the way down

The `$css` prop value is a *Stylix CSS object* and is very flexible in its behavior. These objects can themselves contain a `$css` property that accepts further CSS objects or an array of CSS objects. A nested `$css` object will be recursively merged into its parent, overriding identical properties while preserving the order of keys. Arrays of Stylix CSS objects will be merged into a single object before being merged into its parent.

For example, consider the following Stylix CSS object:

```tsx
{
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  $css: [
    {
      fontSize: 12,
      fontWeight: 'normal',
      color: 'SandyBrown'
    },
    {
      fontSize: 24
    },
  ],
  color: 'SteelBlue'
}
```

Stylix will merge this object into the following:

```tsx
{
  fontWeight: 'normal',
  fontSize: 24,
  color: 'SteelBlue'
}
```

The array is merged together, causing `fontSize: 24` to override the previous definition. The resulting object is merged into the parent, overriding the `fontWeight` property, but not the `color` property, which is defined after the nested `$css` object.

This may seem like an excessive amount of flexibility, since you are you aren't likely to ever define complicated structures like this yourself. However, this flexibility is useful for allowing stylable components to pass on a `$css` prop to an element that also uses `$css`:

```tsx-render
const Link = ({ to, $css, ...styles }) => (
  <$.a 
    href={to} 
    color="ForestGreen" 
    $css={{
      '&:hover': { color: 'LightGreen' },
      $css
    }}
    {...styles} 
  />
);

<Link 
  $css={{ '&:hover': { textDecoration: 'underline' } }}
>
  Link with $css prop
</Link>
```

In the above example, the `Link` component separates the `$css` prop with destructuring and passes it to the `<$.a>` element's `$css` prop so it can be merged with the other styles. Without this treatment, the `$css` prop on the `<$.a>` element would be completely replaced by the prop passed in to the `<Link>` element.

<a href="/other-components" class="next-link">Styling other components</a>
