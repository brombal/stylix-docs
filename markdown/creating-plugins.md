# Creating Stylix plugins

You can customize Stylix's behavior in certain ways using **plugins**. There are specific points in Stylix's lifecycle when plugins are given the opportunity to change its configuration or modify behavior by processing style objects before they are output as CSS.

To create a plugin, simply create an object that conforms to the following interface:

```ts
interface StylixPlugin {
  name: string;
  type: 'initialize' | 'preprocessStyles' | 'processStyles';
  plugin(ctx: StylixPluginFunctionContext, styles: any): any;
  before?: StylixPlugin;
  after?: StylixPlugin;
  atIndex?: number;
}
```

- **name**
  
  A user-friendly name for the plugin, used for debugging purposes only.
  
- **type**
  
  Defines the type of the plugin, which specifies the phase at which the plugin function is invoked; one of the following values:
  
  - **`"initialize"`**
    
    Plugins for this phase are invoked when the `<StylixProvider>` element mounts. They can be used to modify Stylix's configuration in some way before applying any styles. This phase is only invoked once during the lifetime of the app.

  - **`"preprocessStyles"`**
    
    Plugins for this phase are invoked **before** a style object is serialized into a generated class name. This phase must be used to replace or remove any values from a style object that cannot be serialized with `JSON.stringify`, such as functions (in fact, Stylix uses this phase to resolve [theme functions](/themes)).
    
    The result of this phase is used to determine whether the element's styles have changed and need to be updated in the document's stylesheet. Because of this, it is invoked on **every component render**, so its performance is important to keep in mind. It is recommended that plugins should perform their functionality in the **processStyles** phase whenever possible.
    
  - **`"processStyles"`**
  
    Plugins for this phase are invoked to **produce the final style object** that Stylix will output as CSS. 
    
    Each `processStyles` plugin will be invoked by Stylix, passing the previous plugin's result as the input to the next. The final result of all the `processStyles` plugins will be output as CSS.
    
- **plugin**

  This is the function that will be invoked at the given phase. Depending on the plugin's **type**, the function's parameters and return values vary: 
  
  - Plugin functions for the **initialize** phase will receive the current [Stylix context object](/api/useStylixContext), which it can modify as necessary, and should not return anything.

  - Plugin functions for the **preprocessStyles** and **processStyles** will receive 2 parameters: the current Stylix context object, and a clone of the current style object. The function must return a style objectâ€”this can be the object passed as the second parameter, or a new style object. The return value from each plugin function is cloned and passed to the next plugin in that phase.

- **before**, **after**, **atIndex**

  These properties specify another plugin object that this plugin should be inserted **before** or **after**, or the array index at which the plugin should be inserted. If none is specified, the default behavior **appends the plugin to the current list** for the given phase type. See **Plugin ordering** below for more details.
  
## Plugin ordering

Stylix plugin functions are always executed in the same order. The order that the user provides plugins to the StylixProvider `plugins` array is generally **not important**â€”what matters is how the plugin defines its own order using the `before`, `after`, or `atIndex` properties. Stylix maintains a separate order for each plugin type (`"initialize"`, `"preprocessStyles"`, and `"processStyles"`).

Much of Stylix's functionality is provided by built-in plugins, giving you the opportunity to create plugins that modify style objects *before* or *after* Stylix's own plugins alter them. To take advantage of this, you need to know what order Stylix's built-in plugins execute, and what each of them does:

- (There are no built-in **initialize** phase plugins)

- **preprocessStyles** phase:

  | Order | Name | Description |
  |-------|------|-------------|
  | 0     | `defaultPlugins.themeFunctions` | Resolves theme functions to serializable values. |


- **processStyles** phase:

  | Order | Name | Description |
  |-------|------|-------------|
  | 0     | `defaultPlugins.merge$css` | Merges `$css` properties in the parent object. |
  | 1     | `defaultPlugins.mediaArrays` | Resolves media array values to their corresponding media queries. |
  | 2     | `defaultPlugins.propCasing` | Normalizes prop casing and hyphenation to proper CSS property names. |
  | 3     | `defaultPlugins.flattenNestedStyles` | Flattens nested styles by concatenating selectors and handling `&` substitution. |
  | 4     | `defaultPlugins.replace$$class` | Replaces the `"$$class"` magic keyword in all properties and values with the current class name (this is used internally by `useKeyframes()`; until it is determined that it is a more widely-useful feature, it is currently an undocumented internal implementation detail ðŸ¤«). |
  | 5     | `defaultPlugins.defaultPixelUnits` | Adds a "px" suffix to numeric values for appropriate CSS properties |
  | 6     | `defaultPlugins.cleanStyles` | Removes null, undefined, empty strings, and empty object values from styles. |
  
With the above information, you can create a plugin that performs its functionality at any specific step in the list of built-in plugins. 

For example, to create a plugin that operates after the `propCasing` plugin (so you know all CSS property names will have been normalized), you would use the `before` property to specify the `defaultPlugins.propCasing` plugin:

```tsx
import { defaultPlugins } from '@stylix/core';

const myPlugin = {
  type: 'processStyles',
  after: defaultPlugins.propCasing,
  plugin(ctx, styles) {
    // modify styles ...
    return styles;
  }
}
```

To place your plugin at the beginning of the list, use `atIndex: 0`. By default, Stylix will add the plugin to the end of the list. 

**Be aware** that the user may have multiple plugins enabled that "compete" for the same location. Because of this, the exact position of your plugin will be unknown. However, using `before`, `after`, or `atIndex`, you can be sure that a certain amount of processing will (or will not) have been completed (so you don't need to account for nested styles, media arrays, etc).

> Stylix developers will consider changing the order of built-in plugins to be a **breaking change**, so your plugins can specify `@stylix/core` as a peerDependency at a specific major version.

## Creating a plugin

Creating a plugin is as easy as defining an object that implements the interface described above. You can simply export the object from a module, and users can import it and add it to the `plugins` array of their `<StylixProvider>` element.

If your plugin requires user input to configure in some way, you might create a **factory function**:

```tsx
export function myStylixPlugin(options) {
  return {
    name: 'myStylixPlugin',
    // The rest of your plugin...
  };
}
```

The user can then import and call the function to create an instance of the plugin, and install the same way:

```tsx
import myStylixPlugin from 'myStylixPlugin';

const plugin = myStylixPlugin({ ... });

<StylixProvider plugins={[plugin]}>
  ...
</StylixProvider>
```

## Helper functions

Stylix provides a handful of **generic utility functions** to assist you in modifying style objects in useful ways. These can all be imported directly from `@stylix/core`:

- ```ts
  function mapObjectRecursive(
    object: any,
    map: (key: string | number, value: any, object: any, context: any) => Record<string | number, any>,
  ): any;
  ```

  Creates a new object by invoking `map` on each key/value pair in `object` and replacing each pair in `object` by merging in the object returned from `map`. It recursively descends into all object and array values of `object`.
  
  The `map` function will receive the key, the value, the current object being mapped, and a context object. The context object is a plain object that you can modify as needed. The value will persist to subsequent calls to `map` on child properties of `value`. This allows you store and reference arbitrary data as the function recursively descends deeper into `object`.
  
- ```ts
  function walkRecursive<T = any>(
    object: T,
    cb: (key: string, value: any, currentObject: any, context: any) => void,
    context?: any,
  ): T
  ```
  
  Invokes `cb` for each key/value pair in `object`, and continues recursively on each value that is an array or a plain object. Returns `object`.
  
  The `cb` function will receive the key, the value, the current object being mapped, and a context object. The context object is a plain object that you can modify as needed. The value will persist to subsequent calls to `map` on child properties of `value`. This allows you store and reference arbitrary data as the function recursively descends deeper into `object`.
  
  
## Example plugin

The following is a full example of a simple plugin that adds a small set of additional color names that could be passed to any CSS property that accepts colors:

```tsx-render
import $, { 
  StylixProvider,
  mapObjectRecursive
} from '@stylix/core';

const colorMap = {
  amaranth: '#EC295B',
  gamboge: '#E49B0F',
  celadon: '#ABE0AE',
  skobeloff: '#007474',
};

const newColors: StylixPlugin = {
  name: 'newColors',
  type: 'processStyles',
  plugin(ctx, styles) {
    return mapObjectRecursive(styles, (key, value) => {
      if (typeof value === 'string') {
        value = Object.entries(colorMap)
          .reduce((memo, [colorName, colorHex]) => {
            return memo.replace(
              new RegExp(`\\b${colorName}\\b`, 'g'), 
              colorHex
            );
          }, value);
        return { [key]: value };
      }
    });
  },
};

<StylixProvider plugins={[newColors]}>
  <$.div
    color="amaranth"
    background="celadon"
    box-shadow="0 5px 10px gamboge"
    border="2px solid skobeloff"
    padding={10}
  >
    Ugly but colorful
  </$.div>
</StylixProvider>
```
